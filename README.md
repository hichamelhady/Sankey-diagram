# Sankey Diagram by Hicham EL-HADY

Title of chosen chart : Saneky Diagram 

Author : Hicham EL-HADY


## Definition :

Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.
It's a kind of visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another.

It is a two-dimensional graphic that consists of groups of vertical bars interconnected by flow lines. The things being connected are called nodes (or variables) and the connections are called links (or network). 

Sankeys are very good at showing particular kinds of complex information. They are best used when you want to show : 
* Where money came from & went to (budgets, contributions).
* Flows of goods from place to place.
* Flows of energy from source to destination (the primary energy flows in a factory , energy accounts).
* A many-to-many mapping between two domains (e.g., universities and majors).
* Multiple paths through a set of stages (for instance, Google Analytics uses sankeys to show how traffic flows from pages to other pages on your web site).
* Material flow accounts on a regional or national level.
* The breakdown of cost of item or services.
* ...and potentially many more.

The term *“alluvial diagram”* is generally used interchangeably.

## Origin of the name and historical examples :

* Sankey diagram are named after Irish Captain Sankey Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey,  who used this type of diagram in 1898 in a classic figure showing the energy efficiency of a steam engine using arrows having widths proportional to heat loss. [1]

* Charles Minard's Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812 : One of the most famous Sankey diagrams is Charles Minard's Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812. It is a flow map, overlaying a Sankey diagram onto a geographical map. It was created in 1869, so it actually predates Sankey's *'first'* Sankey diagram of 1898. [1]

## Examples :

### American energy system

The ﬂow showed below the text represents the flow of energy in the United States. it is a Sankey diagram that estimates the amount of energy used within the United States organized by the sources from which the energy is provided, to which sectors they serve, and the amount used vs. unused energy. it shows that :
- Primary energy sources supply energy directly to residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors.
- Electricity is generated from a mix of primary sources and it carries energy to those sectors as well.
- Not all energy supplied is actually used :  more than half is lost as waste heat or through inefficiencies (59.4 % is unused).

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" bgcolor="EFEFEF">
      USA energy system [4]</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We conlude from this diagram that :
- Oil is the predominant fuel source in the transportation sector—gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel all come from crude oil.
- Nearly all of the coal mined in the United States goes toward electricity generation, and it is the nation’s largest contributor to the electric supply. Coal also provides direct heat to industries that make steel, concrete, paper, and other essential products.
- Natural gas is the second largest contributor to the nation’s supply of electricity.
- The United States imports a small portion of its electricity.

### Energy balance France 2015 :

This diagram is taken from an interactive web application that allows the user to visualize the annual energy balance within different geographic areas within the EU. the link the the web application is mentionned in sources [5].
the user can select the desired year and country (or supranational entity), the application creates a Sankey diagram on the fly based on those set parameters.

The diagram below shows the Energy Balance in France in 2015.

### Paths from major to profession of whitman grads

Whitman graduate students often embrace non-linear paths from their major to their profession. In fact, many students study a subject they love at Whitman and then pursue a career in an entirely different field.
The sankey diagrams below shows the majors and current professional sector of the last 20 years of Whitman grads. [6]

     "Sankey by Division" [6] </td>
  </tr>
</table>

- Sankey by majors : ( Humanities and Arts)

### Market sizing and Customer segmentation :

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits. Customer segmentation, also called consumer segmentation or client segmentation. [7]

When a company make a customer segmentation, they must follow its evolution over time to verify that the action plan that they have put in place allows them to be more efficient. For this they want to check that the low value segments decrease in favor of other larger segments. the classical way to do it, is to use the matrix of passage. an example is given below

<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
     <image src="Images/segmentation-matrice-passage.png"  align="center">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" bgcolor="EFEFEF">
     "Customer Segmentation by matrix" [8] </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The advantage is that we can see quickly changes from one month to another.

The disadvantage is that it is not very visual, a little "old school" and we can not represent the changes over several months.

So the new way to do it is to use a Sankey diagram and represent migrations in this way:

<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
     <image src="Images/sankey-diagram segmentation.png"  align="center">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" bgcolor="EFEFEF">
     "Customer Segmentation using Sankey diagram" [8] </td>
  </tr>
</table>

So thanks to the sankey diagram, we can quickly see the weight of each segment and the most important migrations.

### Trump’s Twitter Attacks Sankeyfied, Axios

Lazaro Gamio of Axios, a “new media company delivering vital, trustworthy news (…) with expertise, voice AND smart brevity”, has created this Sankey diagram infographic to illustrate the Twitter attacks by Trump and who they were targeting. It a very comical use of sankey diagram but also serious. [9]

<table border="0">
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" bgcolor="EFEFEF">
     "Infographic showing Trump tweet attacks as Sankey diagram. By Lazaro Gamio / Axios " [9] </td>
