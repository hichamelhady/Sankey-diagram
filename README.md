# Sankey Diagram

summary

## Definition :

Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.
It's a kind of visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another.

It is consisted of links and nodes : The things being connected are called nodes and the connections are called links. 

Sankeys are best used when you want to show a many-to-many mapping between two domains (e.g., universities and majors) or multiple paths through a set of stages (for instance, Google Analytics uses sankeys to show how traffic flows from pages to other pages on your web site). They can also visualize the primary energy flows in a factory , the energy accounts, material flow accounts on a regional or national level, and also the breakdown of cost of item or services.
