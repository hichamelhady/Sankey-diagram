# Sankey Diagram

summary

## Definition :

Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.
It's a kind of visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another.

It is a two-dimensional graphic that consists of groups of vertical bars interconnected by flow lines. The things being connected are called nodes (or variables) and the connections are called links (or network). 

Sankeys are very good at showing particular kinds of complex information. They are best used when you want to show : 
* Where money came from & went to (budgets, contributions).
* Flows of goods from place to place.
* Flows of energy from source to destination (the primary energy flows in a factory , energy accounts)
* A many-to-many mapping between two domains (e.g., universities and majors).
* Multiple paths through a set of stages (for instance, Google Analytics uses sankeys to show how traffic flows from pages to other pages on your web site).
* Material flow accounts on a regional or national level
* The breakdown of cost of item or services.
* ...and potentially many more.

The term *“alluvial diagram”* is generally used interchangeably. However, some argue that an alluvial diagram visualizes the changes in the network over time as opposed to across different variables

## Origin of name and historical examples :

* Sankey diagram are named after Irish Captain Sankey Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey,  who used this type of diagram in 1898 in a classic figure showing the energy efficiency of a steam engine using arrows having widths proportional to heat loss. [1]

* Charles Minard's Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812 : One of the most famous Sankey diagrams is Charles Minard's Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812. It is a flow map, overlaying a Sankey diagram onto a geographical map. It was created in 1869, so it actually predates Sankey's 'first' Sankey diagram of 1898. [1]
